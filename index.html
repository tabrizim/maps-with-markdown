# This map contains several historic transatlantic voyages
#### Click the animate button and hover over the markers to see how much intercontinental travel has improved since the day that Christopher Columbus first set sail across the Atlantic

Since the day that Christopher Columbus first set sail across the Atlantic in
search of a new trade route to the East Indies, leading him to discover the Americas after a 70 day voyage,
humanity has made great strides in the area of intercontinental travel. From
improvements in the construction of sail-ships to the invention of steam-ships
and zeppelins, to modern ships and airplanes, this map tells the story of the
development of long distance travel throughout history to its current state.

At the very least this should give you a new perspective in life the next time
you're travelling with Delta or Ryan Airlines. The metaphorical death of dignity
that you suffer during your flights with these companies is inconsequential
when compared with hte very literal and very painful deaths that would've
awaited you during your travels had you attempted a transatlantic voyage before
the 1800's.

The rest of your essay should go under the map, probably.

## in sections like this
also _italics_ and __bold__ which can also be written *like this* or **like this**
etc. Be sure to [make use of links](http://digital.hackinghistory.ca) -- that's one of the reasons we write on the Web, and I've asked you to use links for all yor footnotes/references as well.
